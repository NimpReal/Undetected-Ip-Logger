# Undetected-IP-Logger

IP Logger is a simple tool to log IP addresses.

It will generate a Python script you can send to your victims that will log their IP address.

## How to use:

1. Download [Python](https://python.org) and install it.
2. Extract folder from rar/zip file on your desktop.
3. Run `setup.bat` to download requirements.
4. `start.bat` will run automatically after running `setup.bat`.
5. Input name of your logger
6. Input webhook
7. And it should create the logger inside of the folder.
8. send it to victims and I recommend to obsfucate it because it's Open-Source
